FractionalLineAlgorithm.Trace (startX, startY, endX, endY) will return a series of coordinates that overlap the line segment formed by the positions (startX, startY) and (endX, endY) with approximately 0(Magnitude of line) performance. I named it after my last name because that's what all the cool line algorithm creators are doing (i.e. Bresenham's Line Algorithm) but changed the class name to FractionalLineAlgorithm because using my last name all the time felt weird as fack.

I gave up on commenting while developing this algorithm. I  went all out on bad coding habits to get it done. I'm talkin' copy-pastes, 300+ line function, nested class, fuck namespaces, and more. For some reason, I decided that copy-pasting whole pages of code would be easier than making more functions. Anyways, thanks for reading my life story. There's a lot of room for optimization and tidying up the code which I plan to get to soon. For now, it's tested and working perfectly.
